Working in UX I find good quality note/sketchbook is essential. Having something to hand that requires simply picking up and enables me to get ideas down in can really help my creative workflow.

My seemingly never-ending quest for the ideal note/sketchbook led me to the Leuchtturm1917 A5 dotted softcover.

My reasoning for this choice covered a range of factors.

- Dotted rather then squared - trying not to constrain myself to the grid based layouts squared paper notebooks seem to lead me to.
- Numbered pages with index- I've found this feature, not in Moleskine notebooks, invaluable for keeping track of different, concurrent project notes.
- Removable, perforated pages - allow for easy sharing of notes during workshops or a space for putting disposable ideas.
- Softcover, fold-able and lays flat - the hardback notebooks I've used in the past aren't conducive to having open in front of me while working digitally, again this feels constraining to be either working on paper or on digital, I'm hoping that this feature will help merge my workflows.
- A5, more space then my usual A6 notebooks, opens out to A4 for scanning and copying.

I'll be spending some time using the notebook and will try to put together a follow up review of how it worked in real world situations.

Now to search out the perfect pen.
