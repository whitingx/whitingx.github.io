A recent question on useful resources for learning typography had me digging through my old bookmarks to find the most useful. This post is just a useful future reference and a way to collect these resources together.

An excellent resource by _Matthew Butterick_ ([https://twitter.com/mbutterick](https://twitter.com/mbutterick)) who also created the legal specific [http://typographyforlawyers.com/](http://typographyforlawyers.com/) resource. **Practical Typography** offers an excellent overview of typographic theory and is an excellent starting point for learning more about this area.

### The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web

[http://webtypography.net/toc/](http://webtypography.net/toc/)

A web–specific version of the excellent **Elements of Typographic Style** book maintained by _Richard Rutter_. Very useful overview and intro to the more in–depth and non web–specific original.

### Typekit Practice

[http://practice.typekit.com/](http://practice.typekit.com/)

Useful lessons and references regularly updated and maintained by _Adobe Typekit_.

### Thinking with Type

[http://www.papress.com/other/thinkingwithtype/index.htm](http://www.papress.com/other/thinkingwithtype/index.htm)

Website to accompany the **Thinking With Type** book ([http://amzn.to/1pRrh3V](http://amzn.to/1pRrh3V)). While slightly dated now, the typographic theory is still relevant today.

#### Now Buy the Book

While all these are useful online resources, one of the best investments I can recommend when it come to learning typography is to purchase a copy of _Robert Bringhurst's_ **Elements of Typographic Style** ([http://amzn.to/1itePlL](http://amzn.to/1itePlL))

Having a copy of the book to hand and seeing the typographic theory applied in print can really make a difference to really understanding what is happening and why.

Hopefully these resource will prove useful when looking to learn about typography.
