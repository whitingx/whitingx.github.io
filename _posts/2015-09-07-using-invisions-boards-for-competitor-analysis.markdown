**InVision** - [http://www.invisionapp.com/](http://www.invisionapp.com/) - is a great system for design discussion. The ability to quickly and easily create prototypes or just throw a quick sketch online for a distributed team to review & discuss has been a great addition to my UX workflow.

As well as a recent _Material Design_ style update they have also recently been adding some useful features to move the system beyond basic design discussion and place it more to the centre of a complete design workflow. These features include [mobile testing](http://blog.invisionapp.com/user-testing-mobile-apps/), _Kanban_ style [Workflow boards](http://blog.invisionapp.com/design-project-management-tool/), _mood_ & _brand_ boards in their [Boards_ feature](http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/) & the soon to be added [InSight](http://blog.invisionapp.com/insight-ui-designers-developers-collaboration/) & [InBox](http://blog.invisionapp.com/inbox-turn-design-feedback-into-neat-to-dos/).

## InVision Boards

Working with the [Spencer Group](http://thespencergroup.co.uk/) on a new internal, secure email system I was looking at ways to best discuss ideas with a remote team.

> allowing me to keep all the discussion in one place in a system all the members of my remote team were used to using.

When designing systems and their associated processes I try to look at how others handle the same problems I might face as a way to gather new ideas or to avoid potential issues. In the past I've made use of various third-party systems such as [Kippt](https://kippt.com/), Google Drive & OneDrive to collect screenshots of design elements to share and discuss. The addition of **InVision's** new _Boards_ feature seemed a perfect alternative for these third-party systems, allowing me to keep all the discussion in one place in a system all the members of my remote team were used to using.

### Competitor Analysis Board

I set up a _Competitor Analysis Board_ within **InVision** to conduct an assessment of the relative strengths or weaknesses of similar, email focused products.

This _Board_ lead with an explanation on how the team were using the _Board_ to make it easy for anyone viewing for the first time to understand what they were looking at.

> set a visual hierarchy within the page based on the number of comments an item had received.

Any relevant designs, images, ideas & inspiration could then be added to the _Board_ to allow for the remote team to add comments. I had the idea to make use of the scaling feature found within **InVision** _Boards_ to set a visual hierarchy within the page based on the number of comments an item had received.

> easy to see on viewing the page which items were generating the most discussion.

An item with _none_ or a _single_ comment remained at the default size, once the item had received more than one comment, it's size was increased. This continued as more comments were added meaning that it was easy to see on viewing the page which items were generating the most discussion.

To finish up this collaborative resource, I then made it clear on the _Board_ that all members of the remote team could add to the board any items they might want to discuss. We also used this _Board_ to pull out relevant colour ideas for systems we thought made good use of complementary colour schemes, or who displayed good contrast for call-to-action buttons.

### Conclusion

By making use of **InVision's** new _Boards_ feature - [http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/](http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/) - I was able to quickly develop a system to perform useful competitor analysis inside a design discussion framework already know to everyone on my remote team. While not specifically designed for this use, the flexibility **InVision** offers made it an ideal tool. Here's hoping that the upcoming **InVision** updates mentioned above prove to be just as useful.
