**InVision** - [http://www.invisionapp.com/](http://www.invisionapp.com/) - is a great system for design discussion. The ability to quickly and easily create prototypes or just throw a quick sketch online for a distributed team to review & discuss has been a great addition to my UX workflow.

As well as a recent _Material Design_ style update they have also recently been adding some useful features to move the system beyond basic design discussion and place it more to the centre of a complete design workflow. These features include [mobile testing](http://blog.invisionapp.com/user-testing-mobile-apps/), _Kanban_ style [Workflow boards](http://blog.invisionapp.com/design-project-management-tool/), _mood_ & _brand_ boards in their [_Boards_ feature](http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/) & the soon to be added [InSight](http://blog.invisionapp.com/insight-ui-designers-developers-collaboration/) & [InBox](http://blog.invisionapp.com/inbox-turn-design-feedback-into-neat-to-dos/).

###Boards

Working with the [Spencer Group](http://thespencergroup.co.uk/) on a new internal, secure email system I was looking at ways to best discuss ideas with a remote team.
