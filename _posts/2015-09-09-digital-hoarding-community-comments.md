I help run [a UX community on **Slack**](http://www.designerhangout.co/). We have `~5000 members` but make use of [the free tier](https://slack.com/pricing).

Storage is cheap these days but it's worth thinking about _why_ to archive information, _why_ to keep resources - just because we can doesn't always mean we should.
