The **Kindle** was a revelation for me. I'd always enjoyed reading when traveling but ended up limited by the type of books I felt able to read. Larger hardbacks were not easy to balance when standing on public transport so I ended up defaulting to smaller book, easier to pocket and to hold.

Fortunately, there's a great series of books in just this format but I did find myself missing out on reading certain books if they didn't fit into my persoanl use case.

The introduction of the **Kindle** changed this. I was no longer limited to the physical size of the book I wanted to read.

I'm also a huge fan of eInk - I'm always amazed that it doesn't get more use as a technology and am always pleased when I see interesting use cases for it, such as [this wayfinding solution in Australia](https://www.visionect.com/blog/worlds-first-epaper-traffic-signs)
