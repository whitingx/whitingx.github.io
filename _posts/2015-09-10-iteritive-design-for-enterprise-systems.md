In my experience enterprise systems can be cluncky. By their nature they tend to have been built up over time by a variaty of developers. New _features_ are added on an ad-hoc basis creating a unintuitive mess of UI's and user flows.

These features get added slowly over time, users tend not to notice _new_ features as they are often speciic for a certain user group (in some cases even a certain user).

But this very process of iteritivly adding new features doesn't have to be a weakness, it can become a strength to enterprise systems.
