The excellent `NUX4` conference takes place shortly in Manchester - [http://2015.nuxconf.uk/](http://2015.nuxconf.uk/).

One of the key aspects I try to get across when discussing UX with people is that it's not just _one_ role for a single (or team) of UX professionals in any organisation. One of the key aims in UX is bringing it in as part of wider business processes. As the [Government Digital Services Team](https://twitter.com/gdsteam) often point out, UX is a team sport.

As part of this, it feels that events like `NUX4` really benefit when attended by people who don't class themselves as UX professionals. People who come from others areas of business who are looking to get an idea of how UX fits into these wider processes. More and more businesses are understanding that UX is not something that can be tacked on to the end of a project, instead it needs to be a foundation, underpinning all aspects of a project.

Along with a great line up featuring speakers from [Google](http://2015.nuxconf.uk/speakers/tomer-sharon/), [Tobias & Tobias](http://2015.nuxconf.uk/speakers/alberta-soranzo/), [A List Apart & Rosenfeld Media](http://2015.nuxconf.uk/speakers/sara-wachter-boettcher/) `NUX4` is a welcoming and open conference for anyone interested in how people actually use systems, apps, websites & products.

As a **Project Manager**, visit `NUX4` and find out how UX can fit into _Agile_ & _Lean_ development processes.

As a **Business Analyst**, come along to `NUX4` to see how UX can dig into the user needs of a business.

As a **Developer**, experience `NUX4` and gain a better understanding how UX design thinking can shorten development time and build on consistent, usable patterns.

An open conference suitable for PMs, BAs, Devs, Managers, Analytics Experts & more to offer a better understanding of what UX is and what it can offer any business.

If your role involves working with people in any way, you will benefit from attending, and hopefully enjoying `NUX4`.
