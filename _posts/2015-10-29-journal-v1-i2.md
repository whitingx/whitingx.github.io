### Internet of Things (IoT)

➾ [In-store device gives “Google-like” visitor analytics to bricks and mortar retailers](http://internetretailing.net/2015/10/in-store-device-gives-google-like-visitor-analytics-to-bricks-and-mortar-retailers-2/)

### Technology

➾ [Flarum](http://flarum.org/) - interesting looking open source forum software. _(Code repo availalble here - https://github.com/flarum/flarum)_
