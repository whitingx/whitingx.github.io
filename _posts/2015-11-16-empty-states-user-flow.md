I'm a big avocate of Empty States within systems. Visual cues and indication to the user that a part of the system or a particular UI element is empty, but that this is it's correct current state.

In a way these work like the infamous 'This Page Left Blank' pages I remember from old exams.

However, an empty state alone can act as a barrier to the user - an indication to move along as there is nothing to see here so instead, when desinging these UI elements, I look to offer the user a route away from the empty state, a way to start their journey towards filling in the blank.
