<span class="blog-image-caption">Critique ≠ A Personal Criticism</span>

Receiving feedback, receiving it well and being able to act upon this feedback is a difficult skill to master.

No-one likes to be told _“That's wrong”_ or _“I don't think this works”_ and getting this type of response to a piece of design work you have done, at any stage of your career, can be a knock to a persons confidence.

They key point I keep in mind myself, and advise people I've worked with, is to not take this design critique personally. _You are not your designs._ Hold your ideas lightly, take on this feedback, both good and bad, and use it as a way to move your design forward.

That single comment on one of your _'failed'_ designs might be the spark, the inspiration, that leads you to the right solution.
