So you have a product.

![Product A](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/feature-article-01.png "Product A"){: .blog-image }
<span class="blog-image-caption">Product A</span>

And your product has features.

![Product A - Features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/feature-article-02.png "Product A - Features"){: .blog-image }
<span class="blog-image-caption">Product A - Features</span>

And you have analytics on your product, to see who is using your features.

![Product A - Analytics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/feature-article-03.png "Product A - Analytics"){: .blog-image }
<span class="blog-image-caption">Product A - Analytics</span>

Your analytics show you that, out of the 50 people who use your product 30 use feature A and only 1 uses feature B

![Product A - Analytics Detail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/feature-article-04.png "Product A - Analytics Detail"){: .blog-image }
<span class="blog-image-caption">Product A - Analytics Detail</span>

Great you think, let's focus on Feature A, Feature B is a distraction (our analytics show us). Remove that, and we can be a Feature A focused team.

So you remove Feature B.

![Product A - Feature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/feature-article-05.png "Product A - Feature"){: .blog-image }
<span class="blog-image-caption">Product A - Feature</span>

But what you missed, what your analytics didn't show you, is the 1 person who used Feature B was the person who chose the product. And, while using Feature A benefited each individual who interacted with it, this 1 key person using Feature B benefitted the whole team.

And you removed Feature B - because your analytics told you to - and you didn't actually speak to your users to find out what the key people, the influencers actually used.

So this 1 person, who used feature B and has now lost it, finds another product, one that still includes an equivalent Feature B. And the whole team move over to that.

![Product B](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/feature-article-06.png "Product B"){: .blog-image }
<span class="blog-image-caption">Product B</span>

What do your analytics show now.
