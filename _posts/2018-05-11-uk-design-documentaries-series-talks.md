There are some great documentary films, and more recently series ([https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80057883](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80057883)) about Design. But 2 things I have noticed about these are that;

1. The same Design related films tend to be promoted across different ([http://www.designers.watch/](http://www.designers.watch/)) resources ([https://www.uxseattle.org/movies/](https://www.uxseattle.org/movies/))
2. These films tend to have a US focus, both in subject matter and creation.

As such, I've been looking at films that focus at the great Design history here in the UK, both at a general level and on ones that focus on specific, British Designers.

## 🗣 UK Design Talks

I'm hoping this resource will expand out over time so if you have any suggestions, let me know, I'm always happy to hear about new Design films ツ
