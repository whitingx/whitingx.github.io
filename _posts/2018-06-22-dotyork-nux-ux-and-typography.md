I was recently given the opportunity to return to York to speak at the second DotYork ðŸ”€ NUX crossover event.

## The Adana 8*x*5

The letterpress I spoke of in my talk was the British made **Adana 8*x*5**

## Design Guidelines

The 5 key design guidelines, which align with useful typographic guidelines were;

* Alignment
* Repetition
* Contrast
* Proximity
* Balance

This article - [https://maddisondesigns.com/2009/03/the-5-basic-principles-of-design/](https://maddisondesigns.com/2009/03/the-5-basic-principles-of-design/) - offers a useful overview of these 5 Basic Principles Of Design.

<a name="desguideal"></a>
### Alignment

The research completed by **Microsoft** I mentioned during the talk on how people read copy, and therefore interact with typography, online can be found here in their article *The Science of Word Recognition* - [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/develop/word-recognition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/develop/word-recognition) 

<a name="desguidealline"></a>
#### Line Length

Further information on defining an optimal line-length for your users can be found in these articles.

[https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability)

[https://designshack.net/articles/typography/the-importance-of-designing-for-readability/](https://designshack.net/articles/typography/the-importance-of-designing-for-readability/)

<a name="desguiderep"></a>
### Repitition
<a name="desguidereppair"></a>
#### Font Pairing

A useful intro to combining fonts can be found here;

[A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Pairing Fonts](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-pairing-fonts--webdesign-5706)

These are some great example sites showing font pairing in action;

[http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/)

[https://www.typewolf.com/](https://www.typewolf.com/)

[http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/](http://hellohappy.org/beautiful-web-type/)

[http://typespiration.com/](http://typespiration.com/)

[https://justmytype.co/](https://justmytype.co/)

[https://typ.io/](https://typ.io/)

And these following tools can be used to create and test your own font combinations;

[https://www.fontpair.co/](https://www.fontpair.co/)

[https://www.canva.com/font-combinations/](https://www.canva.com/font-combinations/)

[https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/combinator/latin](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/combinator/latin)

[https://typekit.com/](https://typekit.com/)

And in this area, **Fonts In Use** is a *really* useful site to look at real-world examples of both font combinations and individual fonts in place;

[https://fontsinuse.com/](https://fontsinuse.com/)

<a name="desguidecont"></a>
### Contrast

The following online tool is really useful for quick checking of typographic contrast;

[https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

And this page rounds up other solutions in this area;

[http://www.webaxe.org/color-contrast-tools/](http://www.webaxe.org/color-contrast-tools/)

If making use of **Sketch App** for your UI design, the *Stark* plugin has proved to be the best I've found for checking contrast of text;

[https://sketchapphub.com/resource/stark/](https://sketchapphub.com/resource/stark/)

Information on the *Chrome* DevTools browser integration can be found here;

[https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#contrast](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/devtools#contrast)

<a name="desguideprox"></a>
### Proximity

The following resource offers a useful overview of proximity in regard to design with a specific focus on use in typography;

[https://www.sitepoint.com/principles-of-design-proximity/](https://www.sitepoint.com/principles-of-design-proximity/)

<a name="desguidebal"></a>
### Balance
<a name="desguidebalgrid"></a>
#### Grid Systems

There is *so* much written about the use of grid systems in design, and in particular how they apply to typography but this is a useful starting point for research;

[http://thegridsystem.net/tags/typography/](http://thegridsystem.net/tags/typography/)

The classic ðŸ“™ book ***Thinking With Type*** also offers some useful information in this area;

[http://thinkingwithtype.com/grid/](http://thinkingwithtype.com/grid/)

<a name="desguidebalbase"></a> 
#### Baseline Grid

In regard to the vertical rhythm of typography, look towards information like the following on baseline grids;

[http://typecast.com/blog/4-simple-steps-to-vertical-rhythm](http://typecast.com/blog/4-simple-steps-to-vertical-rhythm)

[https://builttoadapt.io/8-point-grid-vertical-rhythm-90d05ad95032](https://builttoadapt.io/8-point-grid-vertical-rhythm-90d05ad95032)

<a name="vincon"></a>
### Vincent Connare

Information on the Typographer & Designer *Vincent Connare* can be found here;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Connare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Connare)

[http://www.connare.com/](http://www.connare.com/)

### Creating Your Own Font

There a loads of useful tools available to experiment with creating your own font of examining other people's.

**Fontstruct** is a great on-line, block-based font creation tool;

[https://fontstruct.com/](https://fontstruct.com/)

As is **FontArk**;

[http://fontark.net/farkwp/](http://fontark.net/farkwp/)

For Desktop based tools, the open source **FontForge** has always been the classic font/typeface design tool;

[https://fontforge.github.io/](https://fontforge.github.io/)

**FontLab Studio** is more an industry standard, but a more expensive solution;

[https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/](https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/)

And **Glyphs** is the middle-ground between these two options;

#### Butterick's Practical Typography

![Butterick's Practical Typography](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/buttericks_practical_typography.png "Butterick's Practical Typography"){: .blog-image }

An excellent resource by _Matthew Butterick_ ([https://twitter.com/mbutterick](https://twitter.com/mbutterick)) who also created the legal specific [http://typographyforlawyers.com/](http://typographyforlawyers.com/) resource. **Practical Typography** offers an excellent overview of typographic theory and is an excellent starting point for learning more about this area.

#### The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web

[http://webtypography.net/toc/](http://webtypography.net/toc/)

![The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/elements-of-typographic-style-web.png "The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web"){: .blog-image }

A webâ€“specific version of the excellent **Elements of Typographic Style** book maintained by _Richard Rutter_. Very useful overview and intro to the more inâ€“depth and non webâ€“specific original.

<a name="furtherreadprint"></a>
#### Print

#### The Elements of Typographic Style

one of the best investments I can recommend when it come to learning typography is to purchase a copy of _Robert Bringhurst's_ **Elements of Typographic Style** ([http://amzn.to/1itePlL](http://amzn.to/1itePlL))

![Elements of Typographic Style Book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitingx/whitingx.github.io/master/_posts/images/elements-of-typographic-style-book.jpg "Elements of Typographic Style Book"){: .blog-image }

For a lighter overview of typographic history and use take a look at _Simon Garfield's_ **Just My Type** ([https://amzn.to/2yCVIck](https://amzn.to/2yCVIck))

It hopefully offered some useful tips that can be applied to general product design work.

If you'd like to discuss more, or have any questions in this area, I can often be found discussing this topic on-line.
