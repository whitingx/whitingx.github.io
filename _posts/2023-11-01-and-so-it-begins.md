On a whim, the day it starts with no forward planning, no idea of what I’ll write about and no idea of how successful it will be, I’ve decided to take part in this year's NaBloPoMo.

## What is NaBloPoMo.

It is short for National Blog Posting Month. More about the concept and philosophy of the scheme can be found here 👉 [https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-nablopomo.htm](https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-nablopomo.htm).

## What Will I Write About.

With no planning in place, it will be anything and everything. But based on my areas of interest, expect to read mostly about;

* 🔎 Research
* 📐 Design 
* 🔠 Typography
* 🎶 Music

## Will This Work?

Who knows  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ , but it should be an interesting experiment and experience for me. I’ve often felt I’d like to write more, Social Media has never felt like a worthwhile output for ideas and thoughts. The `Signal`:`Noise` ratio has become too skewed towards `Noise` compared to the early days of Social Media where it felt there were conversations and 🔀 connections to be made.

Writing is a known way to better formulate thoughts and ideas. Writing here on my long serving (and long suffering) blog feels like a better way of getting ideas out of my head and on to ‘paper’ without the gaming, algorithms and one-upmanship that Social Media inherently brings.

Let's see how this plays out. 🚀
