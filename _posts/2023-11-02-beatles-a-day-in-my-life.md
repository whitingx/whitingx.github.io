Today marks the day the 🎶 ‘_last Beatles song_’ is to be released.

Now and Then has been preceded by a [short documentary](https://youtu.be/APJAQoSCwuA) and, following the [first playing at 2pm UK time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001rr54), will be followed by a [Peter Jackson directed music video](https://youtu.be/Opxhh9Oh3rg).

I’m a huge fan of **The Beatles**, both as a group and in regard to their solo work, so it’s a moment I’m looking forward to but it has been interesting to read opposing viewpoints on the release of the track.

Like [Free as a Bird](https://youtu.be/ODIvONHPqpk?feature=shared) and [Real Love](https://youtu.be/ax7krBKzmVI?feature=shared), released as part of [The Beatles Anthology](https://www.thebeatles.com/beatles-anthology) set back in 1995, these tracks were not worked on by **The Beatles** as a collective so are they ‘_real_’ Beatles songs?

As a society we seem to spend a lot of time looking back nostalgically, possibly because it’s so worrying looking towards a future full of so much uncertainty. **The Beatles** represent a time where things seemed like they could be better, a peak of success in a 🌍 country that has 📉 declined on both a global and a national level, a 🌻 hippy ideal of a world that never arrived.

Nostalgia can be a damaging mindset in many ways, stopping people from facing up to their issues and taking on future problems. But 🎶 music and the 🎭 arts sit outside this type of nostalgia for me. I remember staying up listening to the 📻 radio for the first notes of _Free as a Bird_ when its embargo was lifted. This moment—tired, half asleep, curious—set my path as a future **Beatles** fan (I’d not given them much thought prior to the marketing push of the _Anthology_ series) and their music has given me so much happiness over the years and led to my own music creation and love of music.

I don’t have high hopes of **Now and Then** being a ‘classic’ Beatles track, but if it provides the spark to someone that I received many years ago, it will have done what it was created to do.
